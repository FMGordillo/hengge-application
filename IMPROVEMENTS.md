# IMPROVEMENTS

## Search Bar

```
Might be easier if it's simple, but maybe a search bar like Gmail might be easier to predict, and give the user the option of advanced filters.
```

## Mail icon

```
There's no clear idea of what that icon is supposed to mean for me(icon_mail_sp). It might be the ones that have been sent? And how difer from those who hasn't been sent?
```

## "Result" text

```
I would've put it on the right or on the bottom of the page, because there's a lot of information in the left right corner of the screen everytime, even on mobile.
```
